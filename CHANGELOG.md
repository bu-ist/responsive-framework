## 2.2.0

- Move footer-branding and footer-menus to their own template partials for
  easier child theme overrides.
- Bugfix on `responsive_primary_nav` introduced in 2.1.12. Only overrides
  container_id and container_class args for bu navigation, rather than all args.
- Bugfix on banner page titles introduced in 2.1.12. Adds a filter to set
  `bu_banner_has_text` to true on the front-end for text layouts, since that is
  the conditional that was added from 2.1.12.
- Add autoprefixer support with grunt-postcss plugin.
- Add browserslist support in package.json for front-end tools like
  autoprefixer.
- Add es6 functionality via a variety of npm packages and Gruntfile
  modifications:
    - `grunt-browserify`: A bundler that allows for easier dependency management
      and gives the ability to use `require` for separating files into modules.
      Polyfills the `require` function used in Node for the browser.
    - `babelify`: Provides a transform for browserify so we can write es6 code.
      This includes using modern `import` and `export` features rather than
      having to use `require`. This package will transpile es6 code into es5
      which browserify can bundle for the browser.
    - `@babel/core`: Required babel library for `babelify` package.
    - `@babel/preset-env`: The recommended "smart" preset for configuring babel
      to take advantage of latest es6 features.
    - `@wordpress/babel-preset-default`: Adds WordPress es6 configurations.
    - `@wordpress/eslint-plugin`: Adds linting rules to adhere to WordPress
      standards for the `eslint` package.
    - `browserify-shim`: makes CommonJS incompatible files browserifyable (files
      that donâ€™t support `require` from the CommonJS module syntax). Also allows
      us to determine what global variables we will use in our project that will
      NOT be bundled, such as jQuery.
    - `eslint` For code climate and text editors to lint and autofix their code.
    - Updates `grunt-contrib-clean` to 2.0.0. Also adds a clean:js task to clear
      contents of directories for new compiled files to reside in, so that old
      irrelevant files don't stick around.
- Adds `grunt-sass-lint` for separate `grunt sasslint` task.
- Adds `browserslist` to package.json so front-end tooling packages like `babel`
  and `autoprefixer` (not yet in Framework) can share the same configurations
  for browser support.
- Adds `.babelrc` configuration file for es6 configs.
- Adds `.eslintrc.json` configuration file for eslint configs.
- Adds `.sasslintrc` for grunt sasslint command and code climate.
- Pulls in Responsive Foundation as an es6 module.
- Refactors `galleries.js` to bundle together with our lightgallery,
  lg-thumbnail pacakges (Also Removed these hardcoded js libraries in
  the repo since they can be pulled in and bundled together with the code).
- Refactors all JS files to be written in modern es6 syntax.
- Updates codeclimate to use eslint-5 and sass-lint instead of scss-lint which
  will eventually be deprecated or will not support latest sass features.

- Responsive Framework "header" templates are now renamed to "masthead"
  templates to avoid confusion with WordPress core's header template
  functionality.
- Page templates have been updated to be more simple. A template part should be
  a repeatable chunk that can be used within the loop. All logic determining
  what should show, how, or where, should be contained in the page template.
- For most post types, single templates only display content in one way. For
  that reason, single templates should not use `get_template_part()` unless more
  than one display variations actually exist.
- Updated profile, news, and page templates to use the above thought process.
- `responsive_post_lists_show_news_meta()` no longer requires a settings array
  to be passed when called. By default, it will utilize the settings selected on
  the news page. An array of settings different form those selected can still be
  passed.

  markup without having to copy the entire template file. Hooks introduced:

- Add `r_script_in_footer` filter for changing the loading location of the
  theme's JavaScript file.

- Add video autoplay to the list of Modernizr checks.
- Introduce `r_get_template_part()`. Adds the ability to theme a specific post
  type's display in archive contexts within a child theme without having to
  change the `archive.php` template that serves as the default for all archive
  pages. For more details see

- Introduce `r_get_archive_sidebar()`. Adds the ability to theme sidebars for
  specific archive contexts without having to change the `archive.php` template
  in a child theme. For more details see
  [55f3602](https://github.com/bu-ist/responsive-framework/pull/153/commits/55f3602dc496439d414f28a24b72dd6e19edec99).

  the inner content container element. Classes are filterable through the
  `r_container_inner_class` filter.

  the outer content container element. Classes are filterable through the
  `r_container_outer_class` filter.
- Fetch the `.mdlrc` and `markdown.rb` files from the [coding standards
  repository](https://github.com/bu-ist/coding-standards/tree/master).
- Restructured HTML and added CSS classes in the footer for cleaner branding
  styles.
- Add extra classes to `post_class()` based on template part and template type.
